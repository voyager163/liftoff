## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: The complete single-maintainer policy remains discoverable
The packaged governance documentation SHALL expose the complete policy covering
GitFlow, zero-approval repository rules, conditional repository-dedicated
provisioning of the VNet-injected larger runner, per-subscription ownership,
explicit outbound-mode selection, settled platform defaults, cost and
service-limit disclosure, import-first infrastructure reconciliation, security
stages and designated tools, the narrow SLSA L3 pinning exception, fail-closed
checks, candidate-to-production merge identity, automated token-safe
back-merges, immutable release evidence, build-once promotion, deployment and
rollback, monitoring and health, DORA metrics, ruleset sequencing, negative
tests, documentation, and workload adaptation. It SHALL identify fixed
assumptions and every capability that Phase 0 must verify while preserving the
Liftoff activation protocol.

#### Scenario: Developer audits generated policy
- **WHEN** a developer opens the canonical generated policy
- **THEN** the full revised standard is readable without requiring network access or an agent
- **AND** links or launchers do not replace its normative content

#### Scenario: Policy capability is unavailable
- **WHEN** documentation describes missing runner-provisioning authority, licenses, monitoring routes, or platform mechanisms
- **THEN** it requires an explicit Phase 0 gap or inapplicability report
- **AND** it prohibits a silent substitute, partial provisioning, or success-shaped placeholder

#### Scenario: Developer reviews runner provisioning
- **WHEN** documentation explains private Staging runner activation
- **THEN** it distinguishes repository-owned Azure resources from organization-level GitHub hosted-compute resources
- **AND** explains applicability, approval, Firewall Basic versus NAT Gateway selection, cost, private connectivity, readback, and teardown ordering

#### Scenario: Developer traces a production release
- **WHEN** documentation explains release qualification and promotion
- **THEN** it distinguishes the qualified candidate commit from the true production merge commit
- **AND** explains how both commits remain bound to the identical artifact and durable evidence

#### Scenario: Existing project receives the policy update
- **WHEN** documentation describes managed-core drift for an older generated governance handoff
- **THEN** it explains that local policy review is required before replacement
- **AND** it does not imply that updating the handoff provisions resources or changes live repository governance
